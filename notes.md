What is free software? [4][4]

> “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community.

> Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”. We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis.

Proprietary Software

>Some software has source code that only the person, team, or organization who created it—and maintains exclusive control over it—can modify. People call this kind of software "proprietary" or "closed source" software. [1][1]

>With free software, the users control the program, both individually and collectively. So they control what their computers do (assuming those computers are loyal and do what the users' programs tell them to do).

With proprietary software, the program controls the users, and some other entity (the developer or “owner”) controls the program. So the proprietary program gives its developer power over its users. That is unjust in itself, and tempts the developer to mistreat the users in other ways.[8][8]

Free software is software that gives you the user the freedom to share, study and modify it. We call this free software because the user is free. [9][9]

[video][9]

Freedoms [4][4]

  - The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose
  - The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
  - The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
  - The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this

## Part II: Companies

What is open source software?

> Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.[1][1]

-----

Why is it awesome to open source (almost) everything? [2][2]

  - great advertising 
  - atract talent
  - the best technical interview possible
  - retain talent
  - effortless modularization
  - reduce duplication of effort
  - it is the right thing to do

> Ok, then what shouldn’t I open source?
> 
> That’s easy. Don’t open source anything that represents core business value.

-----

> Smart companies try to commoditize their products’ complements. [3][3]

## Part III: Developers

Again:

  - great advertising
  - the best technical interview possible
  - effortless modularization
  - reduce duplication of effort
  - it is the right thing to do

Plus:

  - active github
  - contact with top developers
  - free code reviews
  - become a better programmer
  - higher hourly rate
